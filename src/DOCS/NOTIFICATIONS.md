# Notifications System Documentation

## Overview
The notification system in our application provides a way to inform authenticated users about new features, updates, and important information. It's built using the toast notification pattern and integrates with our authentication system to provide personalized, version-aware notifications.

## Features
- Feature announcement notifications for authenticated users
- Version-based notification tracking
- User-controlled notification preferences
- Persistent storage of viewed notifications and preferences
- Support for rich content (links, images)
- Automatic re-checking when tab becomes visible
- Customizable notification duration
- Support for follow-up notifications
- Accessibility-friendly implementation

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **Feature Notifications API** (`src/api/feature-notifications.ts`)
```typescript
interface FeatureNotification {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  version: string;
  date: string;
  details?: {
    link?: string;
    imageUrl?: string;
    category?: string;
  };
}
```

2. **Notification Hook** (`src/hooks/use-feature-notifications.ts`)
- Manages notification state and display logic
- Handles version comparison and user acknowledgment
- Integrates with authentication context

### Usage

#### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import { useFeatureNotifications } from '@/hooks/use-feature-notifications';

function App() {
  // Just import and use the hook - it handles everything automatically
  useFeatureNotifications();
  return <YourApp />;
}
```

#### Adding New Feature Notifications

1. Update the `feature-notifications.ts` file:
```typescript
const notifications: FeatureNotification[] = [
  {
    id: 'feature-2023-1',
    title: '🎥 New Feature',
    description: 'Feature description',
    version: '1.0.1', // Increment this for new features
    date: '2023-12-01',
    details: {
      link: '/feature-page',
      category: 'feature-category',
    },
  }
];
```

2. Update the `currentVersion` to match your deployment:
```typescript
return {
  notifications,
  currentVersion: '1.0.1', // Match your current version
};
```

### Version Management

- Versions follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Users see notifications for versions newer than their last acknowledged version
- Version history is stored per user in localStorage
- Version checks occur on:
  - Initial page load
  - Tab focus
  - After authentication

### Configuration Options

#### Notification Duration
- Default: 10 seconds for main notifications
- Follow-up notifications: 8 seconds
- Can be customized per notification

#### Storage
- Version history stored in `localStorage`
  - Key format: `lastSeenFeature-${userId}`
- Notification preferences stored in Firestore
  - Collection: `user_preferences`
  - Field: `isNotificationsEnabled`
  - Default value: `true`

### User Preferences
- Users can control notification visibility from their profile settings
- Toggle located in Profile → Settings section
- Changes take effect immediately
- Preferences persist across sessions
- Default enabled for new users
- Does not affect critical system notifications

### Best Practices

1. **Content Guidelines**
   - Keep titles short and descriptive
   - Use emojis for visual hierarchy
   - Include clear call-to-action in descriptions
   - Provide relevant links for detailed information

2. **Version Management**
   - Increment versions for significant changes
   - Group related features under the same version
   - Document version changes in changelog

3. **User Experience**
   - Limit concurrent notifications
   - Space out follow-up notifications
   - Provide clear dismissal options
   - Ensure notifications are not disruptive

### Production Implementation

For production environments, replace the static notifications with a backend API:

```typescript
export async function fetchFeatureNotifications(): Promise<FeatureNotificationResponse> {
  const response = await fetch('/api/feature-notifications');
  return response.json();
}
```

You can source notifications from:
- Backend database
- CMS
- GitHub releases API
- Feature flag system

### Testing

#### Basic Notification Flow
1. Ensure you're authenticated
2. Increment the version number in `feature-notifications.ts`
3. Clear localStorage or use a new user account
4. Refresh the application

#### Testing Notification Preferences
1. Navigate to Profile → Settings
2. Locate the "Feature Notifications" toggle
3. Test the following scenarios:
   - Toggle notifications off: No new feature notifications should appear
   - Toggle notifications on: Feature notifications should resume
   - Close and reopen browser: Preference should persist
   - Log in on different device: Preference should sync
4. Verify that the preference is saved in Firestore
   ```typescript
   // Check preference in Firestore
   const userPreferencesRef = doc(db, 'user_preferences', userId);
   const userPreferencesDoc = await getDoc(userPreferencesRef);
   console.log(userPreferencesDoc.data().isNotificationsEnabled);
   ```

### Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Notifications not showing**
   - Check authentication status
   - Verify version numbers
   - Check localStorage for existing acknowledgments

2. **Duplicate notifications**
   - Ensure unique notification IDs
   - Check version comparison logic

3. **Missing follow-up notifications**
   - Verify timing configuration
   - Check details object structure
